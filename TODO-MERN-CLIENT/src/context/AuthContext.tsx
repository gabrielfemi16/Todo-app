/*

>> The React Context API is a built-in feature that enables data sharing between components without the need to explicitly pass props through every level of the component tree, a process known as "prop drilling." It provides a way to create global variables that can be accessed by any component within an application
 
>> createContext is a function provided by React that creates a context object. This context will hold some value that can be shared between components in your application.


>> createContext<AuthContextType | null>(null):


This initializes the context with a default value of null, which is useful for typesafety. It indicates that before any context is provided (e.g., before AuthProvider is wrapped around the app), the context value is null.
 
>> Promise<void>: The Promise is a built-in JavaScript type that represents a value that might not be available yet, but will be at some point in the future (i.e., an asynchronous operation). void means this function doesn't return any value â€” it simply performs the login action asynchronously.
